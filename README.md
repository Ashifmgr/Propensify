Propensity Model to identify how likely certain target groups customers respond to the marketing campaign


<br>Propensity Modeling for Insurance Marketing<br>
This document outlines the approach to building a propensity model for identifying potential insurance customers based on historical data provided by the insurance company.<br>

<br>Deliverables:<br><br>

<br>A report (PDF) detailing:<br>
Design choices and model performance evaluation<br>
Discussion of future work<br>
Source code used to create the pipeline (Python script)<br>
Tasks:<br>

Data Collection:<br>

Download the "Propensify.zip" file containing the data.<br>
Extract the training data (train.csv) and testing data (test.csv).<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):<br>

Analyze data types and identify missing values.<br>
Perform descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of variables.<br>
Create visualizations (histograms, boxplots) to identify potential outliers and relationships between features.<br>
Data Cleaning:<br>

Handle missing values through imputation techniques (e.g., mean/median imputation, mode imputation) or removal based on severity.<br>
Address outliers using capping or winsorization techniques.<br>
Standardize numerical features (e.g., scaling) for improved model performance.<br>
Encode categorical features (e.g., one-hot encoding) if necessary.<br>
Dealing with Imbalanced Data:<br>

Analyze the class imbalance (proportion of potential customers vs. non-customers) in the training data.<br>
Apply techniques like oversampling (replicating minority class data) or undersampling (reducing majority class data) to balance the data.<br>
Feature Engineering:<br>

Create new features based on domain knowledge and EDA insights (e.g., interaction terms, binning categorical features).<br>
Perform feature selection techniques (e.g., correlation analysis, feature importance from models) to identify the most relevant features.<br>
Model Selection and Training:<br>

Split the preprocessed training data into training and validation sets (e.g., 80%/20%).<br>
Train and evaluate several classification models suitable for binary classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).<br>
Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score to evaluate model performance on the validation set.<br>
Choose the model with the best performance on the validation set.<br>
Model Validation:<br>

Evaluate the chosen model on a separate hold-out test set (if available) to assess its generalizability to unseen data.<br>
Analyze the model's confusion matrix to understand its strengths and weaknesses in predicting potential customers.<br>
Hyperparameter Tuning:<br>

Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the chosen model using techniques like grid search or randomized search to optimize its performance.<br>
Model Deployment:<br>

Develop a plan for deploying the model in a production environment, including considerations for infrastructure, data access, and real-time predictions.<br>
Testing Candidate Predictions:<br>

Use the trained model to predict the probability of being a potential customer for each candidate in test.csv.<br>
Apply a threshold (e.g., 0.5) to classify candidates into "Market (1)" or "Don't Market (0)".<br>
Documentation:<br>

Create a README file explaining the installation and execution of the pipeline script.<br>
Describe in the final report how the model benefits the insurance company by optimizing marketing efforts and targeting high-potential customers.<br>
<br>Future Work:<br>

Explore advanced feature engineering techniques like feature importance analysis or dimensionality reduction.<br>
Evaluate the performance of different balancing techniques and their impact on model results.<br>
Consider incorporating customer segmentation strategies for targeted marketing campaigns.<br>
<br>Success Metrics:<br>

Model accuracy on test data > 85% (benchmark)<br>
Implementation of hyperparameter tuning<br>
Model validation on a separate test set (if available)<br>
Bonus Points:<br>

Package the solution as a ready-to-use pipeline with a README file.<br>
Demonstrate strong documentation skills highlighting the value proposition of the model for the insurance company.<br>
Tools and Libraries:<br>

Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn<br>
Additional libraries depending on chosen models (e.g., xgboost for Gradient Boosting)<br>
